OptiPersLP - optimal cycles in persistence via linear programming.

* Tools needed *
1. A working C++ compiler that supports C++11.
2. GNU build system (autotools)
3. libtool
4. Python

* Dependencies *
1. CGAL
2. GLPK
3. BOOST
4. .. and their respective dependencies

* Build and compilation *
1a. If you cloned the project:
  * autoreconf --install
  * ./configure
  * make
  * make check

1b. If you downloaded the distribution package:
  (Not yet ready; coming soon!)
  * ./configure
  * make
  * make check

1c. For advanced configuration, see:
  * ./configure --help

2. (Optional) Installation:
  * make install
	
* Usage *
The main "program" is programs/optiperslp. This program computes
the optimal cycles in persistence of the weighted alpha shape of
the input point cloud.

Input file is in the format of:
x1 y1 z1 r1
x2 y2 z2 r2
	...
Corresponding to 3d coordinates and weights of the weighted point cloud.
Weights are to be given in linear units (NOT squared radius!).

See programs/sample.txt for an example. This is the point cloud of the
8 vertices of a cube. centered at the origin with side length 4.
